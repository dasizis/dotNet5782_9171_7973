hello world
I'm here to write a peace of code

My name is Yael

hi key
this is an extra line

## this is the end!

 > #### to do:
 > - check what works and what does not.
 > - see string added to "getInput". is it OK?
 > - place the while loop of main menu in a more propar place. I didn't find one yet.
 > - place init func in a propar place too.
 > - edit printing function to the wanted format
 > - command
 > - ##check validation - in all functions- very important (can't be done by delegates since we havn't learnt it yet)
 > - arrange random func od Parcel- few statuses and dates.
 > - separate dalObject to files. It's too long
 > - go over the code and see if logic is correct
 > - anything More?

 to do files:
 ### ConsoleUI
 - [X] Activate - in my opinion id does not must be in a sequence
 - [X] AddMenu
 - [X] OptionEnum
 - [X] Program

 ### DAL
 - [X] BaseStation
 - [X] Customer
 - [ ] DalObject - if not found
 - [X] DataSource
 - [X] Drone
 - [X] DroneCharge
 - [X] Enum
 - [ ] Parcel - check the date 
 - [X] Random
